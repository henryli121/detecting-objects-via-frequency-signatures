# detecting-objects-via-frequency-signatures
The project uses a spatiotemporal seismometer to collect signals at regular intervals, and analyzes them in the frequency domain using fast Fourier transform to detect object location. Applying filters to reduce noise and enhance signals helps to locate the object more accurately, and results are presented through figures.
